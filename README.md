# 📧 Email Classification Using ML

This project demonstrates the application of Machine Learning techniques to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham** (non-spam).  
Using a dataset of labeled emails, the model is trained to identify and filter out unwanted spam emails, improving email management efficiency.
